## TO DO 

Home/List Page: 
[] When a movie poster is clicked the user should be brought to the /details view 


Details Page: 
This should show all details including ALL genres for the selected movie, including title, description, and the image, too! Use Sagas and Redux to handle these requests and data.

[] The details page should have a Back to List button, which should bring the user to the Home/List Page
